# Examples:
Example 1: [
Relevant retrieved text:
            Nominative:
            The subject of a verbal sentence is usually in the nominative case. For example, "الولد يدرس" (al-walad yadrus - The boy studies). 
            Accusative:
            The direct object of a verb is in the accusative case. For example, "أنا أقرأ الكتاب" (Ana a'qra' al-kitab - I read the book). 
            Genitive:
            The genitive case is used in several contexts, including after prepositions, when indicating ownership, or when the noun is used with a second noun in a descriptive context (known as idhaafa). 

Key Points:
            "الرفع is primarily used for the subject, predicate, and doer.",
            "النصب is primarily used for the done-to and after حروف which trigger its use.",
            "الجر is primarily used after prepositions."

User recall:
            Arabic has three cases. One of the cases is رفع, another is جر, and finally we have نصب. Raf' is used for subjects, jarr is used for prepositions, and nasb is used for the done-to. 
            These cases help us understand the role of certain words in Arabic
